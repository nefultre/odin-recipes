    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An excellent and simple recipe, these will make some delicious green onion cakes that are addictive and are just as good, if not better, than the store bought ones.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1&thinsp;&frac14; cups boiling water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to tast</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a fork to mix flour and boiling water in a large bowl. Knead dough into a ball. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; let dough rest for 30 to 60 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Evenly divide dough into 16 pieces. Roll each piece into a 1/4 inch thick circle. Brush each circle with oil, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with about 1 teaspoon of green onions. Roll up, cigar style; coil each pancake and pinch open ends together to form a disc. Roll each circle flat to about 1/4 inch thickness.
        </li>
        <li>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet. Fry cakes until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Add more oil between batches, if necessary.
        </li>
    </ol>
