    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Craving Chinese tonight? Well look no further than your own kitchen! This is one of the classics! Crispy wok fried beef with a lovely soy sauce and ginger dressing combined with onions, assorted bell peppers, garlic and carrots to create a succulent stir-fry! Serve with your choice of starch!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li> 1 pound flank stead, cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>1/2 cup canola oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, cut into matchstick-size pieces</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, cut into matchstick-size pieces</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into matchstick-size pieces</li>
        <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>5 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place cornstarch in a large bowl; gradually whisk in water until smooth. Whisk eggs into cornstarch mixture; toss steak strips in mixture to coat.</li>
        <li>Pour canola oil into wok 1-inch deep; heat oil over high heat until hot but not smoking. Place 1/4 of the beef strips into hot oil; separate strips with a fork. Cook, stirring frequently, until coating is crisp and golden, about 3 minutes. Remove beef to drain on paper towels; repeat with remaining beef.</li>
        <li>Drain off all but 1 tablespoon oil; cook and stir carrot, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, green onions, ginger, and garlic over high heat until lightly browned but still crisp, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk sugar, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and red pepper together in a small bowl. Pour sauce mixture over vegetables in wok; bring mixture to a boil. Stir beef back into vegetable mixture; cook and stir just until heated through, about 3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cooks' Note:</h2>
    <p>This is the original recipe but I like to add about 1/4 cup of teriyaki sauce as a variation. I also like to add sesame oil to the oil when I fry the beef.</p>
