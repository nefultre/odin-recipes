This is the first project on TOP. I will be building a basic recipe website with a home page and multiple linked recipe pages. I will need to utilize my aqcuired knowledge of HTML tags, document flow, and file structure to implement this project successfully.

I learned more than I expected. I solidified my understanding of file structure (project directories and subdirectories), of the basic git terminal workflow, of the function and utility of github remote repositories, and of html document structure. Bonues: I learned a handy new skill for adding special characters into html document text by using entity codes, I learned how to utilize the Google fonts api to import unique fonts into my css stylesheets for application, and I exercised my knowledge and understanding of the css box model and flexbox to create a very garrish and ridiculous but fun design for my site.
